**一月十三日**

**经文:** **斧头就漂上来了。（列王纪下六：6）**

斧头丢失了，几乎是没有希望能寻回。整队先知的名誉被危及了，他们的上帝之名也有被羞辱的危险，因为斧头是借来的。出乎众人所预料的，斧头居然浮上了河面。在人所不能的事，在上帝却能（参阅路18：27）。我认识一位基督徒，他被召去进行一项远超过他能力的工作。该项工作是那么艰巨，甚至仅仅一试的念头也是荒谬的。然而，他是被召了，他就对该项工作生出信心。上帝重视他的信心，在他求助以前，帮助由天而来，斧头漂起来了。在主家中有一弟兄，曾经陷入了严重的经济困境中。他若能将产业的一部分出售，或许可以偿还债务，且有剩余。可是，他被突然临到的压力所控制，求助无门时，信心将他领到永不令人失望的帮助者面前，斧头漂起来了，困难转移了，他的步伐也坚定了。第三位所面对的是一严重的邪恶境况。经过教导、遣责、警诫和代祷，皆无成效。这位年轻的基督徒身上的老亚当太顽强了，不愿意放弃固执的心灵。然而，一场激烈争战的祷告展开了，不久从天降下福祉。刚硬的人破碎了，斧头漂起来了。你巴望的事项是什么？今晚在你身上的沉重担子是什么？带到上帝面前吧！古代先知的上帝仍然活着，为了要帮助祂的众圣徒。祂不会让你缺乏。相信万军之耶和华！你也将见到上帝的手为祂的子民行出奇异的事。凭着信心，让它实现在你的身上。记住，斧头是会漂上来的！

**Evening, January 13**

**Scripture:** **“The iron did swim.”(2 Kings 6:9)**

The axe-head seemed hopelessly lost, and as it was borrowed, the honour of the prophetic band was likely to be imperilled, and so the name of their God to be compromised. Contrary to all expectation, the iron was made to mount from the depth of the stream and to swim; for things impossible with man are possible with God. I knew a man in Christ but a few years ago who was called to undertake a work far exceeding his strength. It appeared so difficult as to involve absurdity in the bare idea of attempting it. Yet he was called thereto, and his faith rose with the occasion; God honoured his faith, unlooked-for aid was sent, and the iron did swim. Another of the Lord's family was in grievous financial straits, he was able to meet all claims, and much more if he could have realized a certain portion of his estate, but he was overtaken with a sudden pressure; he sought for friends in vain, but faith led him to the unfailing Helper, and lo, the trouble was averted, his footsteps were enlarged, and the iron did swim. A third had a sorrowful case of depravity to deal with. He had taught, reproved, warned, invited, and interceded, but all in vain. Old Adam was too strong for young Melancthon, the stubborn spirit would not relent. Then came an agony of prayer, and before long a blessed answer was sent from heaven. The hard heart was broken, the iron did swim.\
  Beloved reader, what is thy desperate case? What heavy matter hast thou in hand this evening? Bring it hither. The God of the prophets lives, and lives to help his saints. He will not suffer thee to lack any good thing. Believe thou in the Lord of hosts! Approach him pleading the name of Jesus, and the iron shall swim; thou too shalt see the finger of God working marvels for his people. According to thy faith be it unto thee, and yet again the iron shall swim.
